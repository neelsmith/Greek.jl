# PolytonicGreek.jl


*Rigorously defined orthographies for text in polytonic ancient Greek.* 

The `PolytonicGreek` package supports working with accented ancient Greek encoded in Unicode.  


## An abstract interface

`GreekOrthography` is an abstract  type for functions that:


- sort Unicode Greek strings by the logic of the Greek alphabet
- syllabify Greek strings
-  work with accents, including correct placement for recessive and persistent accent patterns
- implement the `OrthographicSystem` interface (from the HCMID [Orthography package](https://hcmid.github.io/Orthography.jl/stable/)), with semantic tokenization of text in polytonic Greek


## Concrete implementations

This package  includes `PolytonicGreek`, an implementation of the `GreekOrthography` type for literary Greek as it appears in standard printed editions. 

Other implementations are possible. Examples are:


- [ManuscriptOrthography](https://homermultitext.github.io/ManuscriptOrthography.jl/stable/) (from the Homer Multitext project) for working with the orthography of polytonic Greek in medieval manuscripts
- [AtticGreek](https://github.com/neelsmith/AtticGreek.jl), an implementation for the epichoric alphabet used in Athens before 403 BCE
