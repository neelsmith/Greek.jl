# PolytonicGreek.jl


*Rigorously defined orthographies for text in polytonic ancient Greek.* 

The `PolytonicGreek` package supports working with accented ancient Greek encoded in Unicode.  It defines an abstract `GreekOrthography` type for functions that:

- implement the MID Orthography interface, with semantic tokenization of text in polytonic Greek
- sort Unicode Greek strings by the logic of the Greek alphabet
- syllabify Greek strings
-  work with accents, including correct placement for recessive and persistent accent patterns

The current package includes an implementation of the `GreekOrthography` type for literary Greek as it appears in standard printed editions, but other implementations are possible, such as for epichoric Greek alphabets.  For an implementation for the archaic Attic alphabet, see the [AtticGreek.jl](https://github.com/neelsmith/AtticGreek.jl) package.
