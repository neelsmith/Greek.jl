`PolytonicGreek` defines an abstract type called `GreekOrthography`, which in turn is a 
subtype of the [Orthography package](https://github.com/hcmid/Orthography.jl)'s `OrthographicSystem`.

Implementations of `GreekOrthography` can therefore can be used with generic functions of the `Orthography` package to assess the validity of characters and strings, and to tokenize a string into a series of explicitly classified tokens.

In addition, they can use functions specific to implementations of `GreekOrthography` to remove and add accents to words, to break words into syllables, and to sort words according to the logic of the Greek alphabet.


## An implementation for literary Greek

The `literaryGreek()` function creates a `LiteraryGreekOrthography` object. This  is a subtype of `GreekOrthography` configured to work with texts in the orthography of standard printed editions of literary Greek. 

In the following code blocks, you can see its inheritance from `Orthography` via `GreekOrthography`.  This gives you access both to functions applying to any subtype of `Orthography` and to functions applying to subtypes of the more specific `GreekOrthography`.



```@example loaded
using PolytonicGreek
lg = literaryGreek()
typeof(lg)
```

```@example loaded
typeof(lg) |> supertype
```

```@example loaded
typeof(lg) |> supertype |> supertype
```


### From the `OrthographicSystem` interface

#### Assessing characters and strings
    
    
```@example loaded
using Orthography
omicron = "ο"
validchar(lg, omicron)
```

```@example loaded
latinO = "o"
validchar(lg, latinO)
```


```@example loaded
greek = "μῆνιν ἄειδε"
validstring(lg, greek)
```

```@example loaded
notgreek = "μῆνιν?"
validstring(lg, notgreek)
```


#### Tokenizing strings
    
Subtypes of `Orthography.OrthographicSystem` include a `tokenizer` function that analyzes a string encoded in this orthographic system into an Array of `OrthographicToken`s, which are classified string values.  For example, the string *μῆνιν ἄειδε,* is analyzed as three tokens, two of type `LexicalToken`, and one of type `PunctuationToken`

```@example loaded
tokenized = lg.tokenizer("μῆνιν ἄειδε,")
length(tokenized)
```

```@example loaded
tokenized[1].text
```

```@example loaded
tokenized[1].tokencategory
```


```@example loaded
tokenized[end].text
```


```@example loaded
tokenized[end].tokencategory
```

### From the `GreekOrthography` interface

The following functions allow you to specify a `GreekOrthography` to apply, but also allow you to default to using the `LiteraryGreekOrthography`.

#### Accentuation

Strip accents from a string according to a specified implementation of `GreekOrthography`.

```@example loaded
rmaccents("πολλά", ortho = lg)
```

Equivalently:

```@example loaded
rmaccents("πολλά")
```

You can add accents to an unaccented word by ....

accentword("ἀνθρωποι", :RECESSIVE) 

#### Syllabification

syllabify

#### Sorting
