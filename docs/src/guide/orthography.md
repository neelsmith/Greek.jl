# Orthography

## Literary Greek orthography

The `literaryGreek` function creates a `LiteraryGreekOrthography`.  
This is a subtype of the [Orthography.jl package](https://github.com/hcmid/Orthography.jl)'s `OrthographicSystem` and therefore can be used with generic functions to assess the validity of characters and strings, and to tokenize a string into a series of explicitly classified tokens.


```jldoctest loaded
using PolytonicGreek
lg = literaryGreek()
typeof(lg)

# output

LiteraryGreekOrthography
```

```jldoctest loaded
typeof(lg) |> supertype

# output

Orthography.OrthographicSystem
```

You can therefore use generic functions from the `Orthography` package to determine if a character or string is valid in this orthography, to enumerate valid characters and types of tokens that are recognized in this orthography, and to analyze strings in this orthography as sequences of classified tokens.



### Assessing characters and strings


```jldoctest ortho
using Orthography, PolytonicGreek
ortho = literaryGreek()
omicron = "ο"
Orthography.validchar(ortho, omicron)

# output
true
```

```jldoctest ortho
latinO = "o"
Orthography.validchar(ortho, latinO)

# output
false
```


```jldoctest ortho
greek = "μῆνιν ἄειδε"
Orthography.validstring(ortho, greek)

# output
true
```

```jldoctest ortho
notgreek = "μῆνιν?"
Orthography.validstring(ortho, notgreek)

# output
false
```

### Enumerating codepoints and token types



### Tokenizing strings

Subtypes of `Orthography.OrthographicSystem` include a `tokenizer` function that analyzes a string encoded in this orthographic system into an Array of `OrthographicToken`s, which are classified string values.  For example, the string *μῆνιν ἄειδε,* is analyzed as three tokens, two of type `LexicalToken`, and one of type `PunctuationToken`

```jldoctest loaded
tokenized = lg.tokenizer("μῆνιν ἄειδε,")
length(tokenized)

# output

3
```

```jldoctest loaded
tokenized[1].text

# output

"μῆνιν"
```

```jldoctest loaded
tokenized[1].tokencategory

# output
Orthography.LexicalToken()
```


```jldoctest loaded
tokenized[end].text

# output

","
```


```
jldoctest loaded
tokenized[end].tokencategory

# output
Orthography.PunctuationToken()
```


## Under the hood

The package can enumerate all valid Unicode code points for alphabetic and punctuation characters.

```jldoctest loaded
puncts = PolytonicGreek.punctuation()

# output

".,;:"
```

```jldoctest loaded
PolytonicGreek.alphabetic() |> length

# output
267
```

It uses these to categorize tokens and to divide strings into  sequences of alphabetic and punctuation characters.

```jldoctest loaded
PolytonicGreek.isAlphabetic("μῆνιν")

# output

true
```

```jldoctest loaded
PolytonicGreek.isPunctuation(":")

# output

true
```


```jldoctest loaded
PolytonicGreek.splitPunctuation("ἄειδε,")

# output

2-element Array{AbstractString,1}:
 "ἄειδε"
 ","
```


### Functions supporting tokenization


The `tokenforstring` function returns a single `OrthographicToken`.


```jldoctest loaded
t = PolytonicGreek.tokenforstring("μῆνιν")
t.tokencategory

# output

Orthography.LexicalToken()
```

```jldoctest loaded
t.text

# output

"μῆνιν"
```


The `tokenizeLiteraryGreek` is the function assigned to the `tokenizer` member of `LiteraryGreekOrthography`s.  Using it by itself is identical to creating a `LiteraryGreekOrthography` and using its generic `tokenize` function, as illustrated above.

```jldoctest loaded
tokens = PolytonicGreek.tokenizeLiteraryGreek("μῆνιν ἄειδε,")
length(tokens)

# output

3
``` 

```jldoctest loaded
tokens[end].text

# output

","
```

```jldoctest loaded
tokens[end].tokencategory

# output
Orthography.PunctuationToken()
```
