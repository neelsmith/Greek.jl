# PolytonicGreek.jl

A Julia module for working with polytonic ancient Greek.

See documentation [here](https://neelsmith.github.io/PolytonicGreek.jl/stable/).

## Pluto notebooks

The `pluto` directory has notebooks demonstrating usage of the package that you'll be able to run once the package is available from the Julia Registry.  It's currently out of date, and needs to be updated.
